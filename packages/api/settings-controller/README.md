# Settings Controller

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-settings-controller` exposes generated `ctx.remote.settings`, `ctx.remote.credentials`, and the fixed `ctx.remote.errgrindCodexAuth` namespace. The latter is an ErrGrind fork integration for ChatGPT Codex device-code sign-in; it is not a general authorization browser. It returns only lifecycle state and a validated verification URI/user code, and never returns the stored grant or provider errors. The other namespaces serve browser configuration surfaces: they return redacted settings and credential metadata, support settings and credential writes without returning secret values, and open provider-owned settings or Agent preset locations on the Host desktop. When a provider is absent, the namespace remains registered and returns an actionable configuration error.

## Use this package

Mount this package as a Loader entry in a profile that serves browser configuration. The entry registers both namespaces independently of their providers so a missing provider produces a named configuration error at invocation. Its generated descriptors enter the strict Typert registry, while the settings and credential Definitions remain plain Cordis Services with no wire obligations of their own.

`describe(refs)` answers one map keyed by the requested names, so a settings page describing every reference its rows carry settles those rows together. It accepts at most 64 names per call, reports an invalid name or empty write value as `bad-request`, and copies each answer field by field — a provider returning more than `CredentialInfo` declares cannot widen what crosses. Valid `set(ref, value)` and `unset(ref)` calls report a provider refusal as `credential-rejected`, carrying the provider's message with only the reference in its details. Secret values cross in this direction only: no method here returns one.

`settings.describe()` returns deployment facts and every namespace under `redactSecrets: true`. `settings.update`, `settings.replace`, and `settings.mutate` expose the settings service's three write operations and return the namespace's new redacted view; stale writes use `settings-conflict` and other provider refusals use `settings-rejected`.

`settings.openSettingsDocument()` prepares the provider-owned document and opens it with the native text editor; it accepts no browser-supplied filesystem target.

`errgrindCodexAuth.status()` reads safe availability and sign-in state. `beginDeviceCode()` starts only the OAuth flow for `llm-pi-ai/openai-codex` and returns immediately; `noticesAfter(cursor)` returns bounded, validated device-code instructions, and `cancel()` withdraws an attempt this controller started. The browser cannot choose a credential key or method, supply arbitrary prompt answers, or receive grant fields. This fixed namespace belongs to the ErrGrind product fork and should move to an ErrGrind-owned package if the Host Remote surface is generalized.

## Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-api-settings-controller) is the exhaustive source for accepted fields and their JSDoc.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as settings and credential configuration are browser and Host state and register no prompt, tool, or session event.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; reading or writing these configuration values does not alter model requests already in flight.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The batch bound is fixed at 64 references and is not a deployment-configurable field.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The settings and credential seams own storage and update events, while this package only projects their methods onto the wire.
